    Wikis are powered by wiki software, also known as wiki engines. Being a form of content management system, these differ from other web-based systems such as blog software or static site generators in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader.<br> Wikis have little inherent structure, allowing one to emerge according to the needs of the users.[2] Wiki engines usually allow content to be written using a lightweight markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor.
